    "Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry with Telco companies aiming to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations to grow their revenue-generating base. Looking at churn, different reasons trigger customers to terminate their contracts, for example, better price offers more interesting packages, bad service experiences, or changes in customersâ€™ personal situations. Prediction models can be utilised to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take countermeasures such as discounts, special offers, or other gratifications to keep their customers.This project aims to develop a predictive model to predict customer churn for SyriaTel.The primary objective is to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn and recommend actionable insights to retain them. SyriaTel's stakeholders especially the company's management and marketing team stand to learn and benefit more from the project. Other companies within the telecommunications industry are also in place to learn and benefit."
